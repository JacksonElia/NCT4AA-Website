This is the website I made for the organization, [North Carolina Teens for Abortion Access](https://www.instagram.com/ncteensforabortionaccess/). This website was made from scratch without a template. If you want to use this code for your own website/project, go ahead! **Just make sure you credit [me](https://github.com/Traptricker) or this [website](https://nct4aa.github.io/) somewhere.**

## Inspiration
When some of the members of NCT4AA asked me for help making a website, I couldn't say no. They showed me a previous website that they had made. I took some inspiration from some of the good parts of the website, polished some of the questionable parts, and added my own style/ideas.

## Colors
I got the colors from their logo, and added a few of my own.

| Color                   | Hex              | RGB           | 
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Main Theme Color        | **#009F00**      | 1, 141, 1     |
| Secondary Theme Color   | **#F28C9E**      | 242, 140, 158 |
| Main Text Color         | **#FFFFFF**      | 255, 255, 255 |
| Secondary Text Color    | **#0B510A**      | 11, 81, 10    |
