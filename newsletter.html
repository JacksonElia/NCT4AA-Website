    <h2 class="article-title">Carrburritos, WHUP, and Bake Sales!</h2>
    <p>Friends of NCT4AA,</p>
    <p>In the past couple of weeks, we’ve hosted our first benefit night in collaboration with
      Carrboro’s very own, Carrburritos!! With almost $500 raised, that brings our total raised for
      CAF up to over $1,700! Turnout for the event was great and everyone had a great time enjoying
      the selection of fresh foods at Carrburritos. I mean, just look at these smiling faces!</p>
    <img src="images/carrburritos.jpg" alt="burrito" style="width:100%">
    <p>In addition, members Caroline Zhou and Maya Vizuete got to visit Bob down at Hillsborough’s
      premier radio station, WHUP FM 104.7, to talk about the organization, what they do beyond the
      organization, and why they do it.</p>
    <p>At the moment, we’re working on more informative posts such as those regarding judicial
      technicalities and yesterday, we hosted our second bake sale in Lake Hogan from 2-6pm.</p>
    <img src="images/baking.jpg" alt="baking" style="width:100%">
    <p>Within the organization, we’re continuing to discuss what events would help engage the
      community, how to curate our social media impact, and so much more!</p>
    <p>Love, NCT4AA</p>

    <h2 class="article-title">What we’ve been up to…</h2>
    <p>In the last two weeks, we’ve accomplished so much! All our members remain active, motivated,
      and engaged in the fight to increase abortion access in the Carolinas by fundraising for
      Carolina Abortion Fund (CAF). We had our first event on Sunday, 7/10: a bake sale!
    </p>
    <p>Here’s a quick recap if you didn’t stop by:
      It was rainy, but that didn’t discourage us. We sold treats like cookies, lemon bars,
      cupcakes, and more. We set up a table located by the clubhouse of Lake Hogan Farms in Chapel
      Hill, NC, and raised over $250 that afternoon!</p>
    <img src="images/what-up-to.jpg" alt="bake sale" style="width:100%">
    <p>If you weren’t there to support us but you wanted to, don’t worry! Our next event is coming
      up: a Carrburritos benefit night, on Saturday, 7/16, all day! 10% of Carrburritos proceeds
      will be going to CAF! Our members will be there at 7pm that night if you want to meet the
      faces behind NCT4AA.</p>
    <p>There will be many more events to come, so please stay tuned for more!</p>
    <p>On top of our events, we continue to hold weekly internal meetings to discuss future plans.
      We also actively engage on social media and put flyers up in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro area to
      increase our presence. Here’s to abortion access!</p>
    <p>XOXO, NCT4AA</p>

    <h2 class="article-title">Our First Week</h2>
    <p>
      Our first week here at NCT4AA has been a success! Our founder, Caroline, has done an
      incredible job bringing together upwards of a dozen smart, passionate, and engaged young
      women. We’ve already brainstormed and scheduled multiple events to foster our later endeavors.
      Needless to say, this project is still in the early stages, but we are proud of the progress
      we’ve already made, and eager to see the impact this organization will have in the future!
    </p>

    <p>These were our preliminary logo options! We finally settled on our wonderful logo, which was
      designed by the lovely Maya Vizuete, who is part of both our Design Team and our
      Communications Team. </p>
